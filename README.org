#+TITLE: Arma 3 - Artillery computer

Easy to use artillery calculator for Arma 3, intended to be used in
King of the Hill.

The setup isn't exactly user friendly, but it provides an easy enough interface
to be used while playing Arma.

1. Determine your own position with two four digit grid references and your
   altitude.
2. Start the program with the following parameters:
   #+begin_src bash
artillery XGRDYGRD ALT
   #+end_src
   (XGRD = x-component of your grid reference, YGRD = y-component, ALT=altitude
   above sea level)
3. For each target again determine the exact grid reference and altitude and
   simply enter them in the interactive shell with the same format:
   #+begin_src bash
XGRDYGRD ALT
   #+end_src
   If the values you have entered can be targeted all necessary values will be
   returned.
5. For each new enemy simply repeat step 3. and enter new coordinates.
